## üìñ Project Overview

This project involved the **CFD analysis and physical model validation** of a **pump intake structure** with **17 vertical turbine (VT) pumps** and a total flow rate of **32 cubic meters per second**. The primary goal was to optimize the intake design to reduce hydraulic issues, such as swirl and vortices, which can impact pump efficiency and lifespan. The analysis achieved close alignment with the physical model study, with a validation error of **less than 5% in swirl angle data**.

### üèÜ Key Objectives

1. **Optimize** the pump intake structure design to improve hydraulic performance and reduce swirl.
2. **Validate** CFD simulations through physical model studies, achieving accurate predictions with minimal error.
3. **Ensure** adherence to Hydraulic Institute (ANSI/HI) standards for pump intake design.

## üîç Methodology

1. **Geometry and Meshing**  
   - The **3D CAD model** of the pump intake structure was created using **CATIA V5**.
   - Geometry cleanup and meshing were done in **ICEM CFD**, with specific attention to boundary layer meshing around the intake and pump sump.

2. **Simulation Setup**  
   - **Software:** ANSYS CFX / Fluent
   - **Boundary Conditions:** Defined based on inflow rates and pump operating conditions.
   - **Convergence Criteria:** Monitored for stability in flow variables to ensure accurate results.
   - **Validation Metrics:** Swirl angle and velocity contours across critical sections in the sump.

3. **Physical Model Study**  
   - A physical model of the intake structure was constructed, and experimental data was collected for swirl angles and flow patterns.
   - **Validation Results:** CFD results were compared with physical study data, achieving a validation error of less than 5% for swirl angle measurements.
